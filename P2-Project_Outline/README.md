# Project Outline


## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://github.com/jsjue/liftoff-assignments/edit/master/P2-Project_Outline/)

## Submission Instructions

### Overview


My project will be a booking instrument for musician and artists or their manager. To provide a easy way to book venues across the US for musicians wishing to tour. The will be an interactive map to click on the region you wish to book a tour and it will link the artist with smaller venues and the contact information of the venue.
Eventually, I would like the artists to be able to rate each venue for ease of working with and perhaps show quality.
This project is spurred by a friend of mine who recently started a record label and has an artist who will be going out on tour.


### Features
Email signup: visitors to the site will be able to register their email to receive emails.

Email Release schedule: the introduction to the candidate through emails will occur in a prescribed manner.

Share: visitors may share the site with thier friends through email link, twitter or facebook.

User login: Approved Users will be able to log in, either by creating accounts in the system, or by using a third-party authentication provider (e.g. Google Authentication). All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users.

Volunteer signup: Visitors will be able to add their information to volunteer to the system, and to asign up for volunteering at events.

### Technologies
I will be using Springboot, Thymeleaf, Java, Bootstrap, user authentication, My SQL


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to authenticate users, perhaps through 3rd party, how to create a framework for getting emails into a DB in SQL and then putting those emails on a "timed" release.
I will have to test this process to make sure it functions as it should.
