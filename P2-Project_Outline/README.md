## Submission Instructions

### Overview


My project will be a booking instrument for musician and artists or their manager. To provide a easy way to book venues across the US for musicians wishing to tour. The will be an interactive map to click on the region you wish to book a tour and it will link the artist with smaller venues and the contact information of the venue.
Eventually, I would like the artists to be able to rate each venue for ease of working with and perhaps show quality.
This project is spurred by a friend of mine who recently started a record label and has an artist who will be going out on tour.


### Features

Clickable map, which accesses information from a spreadsheet, with region feature where the user can click on a specific region ie Midwest and get a list of venues.

When each venue is clicked the information for each venue is diplayed.

The ability to add a venue to the table through an entry form.




### Technologies
I will be using Springboot, Thymeleaf, Java, Bootstrap, My SQL, map function


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to be able to use a map to connect to a DB and access the information therein.
I will have to test this process to make sure it functions as it should.
