[Project Outline Assignment](https://github.com/jsjue/liftoff-assignments/edit/master/P2-Project_Outline/)

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My Project will be an drip marketing program for candidates running for political office. It will allow visitors to the site to sign up for email newsletters which will be deciminated in a prescribed manner, so as to engage and tell a story. Eventually the newer signups will "catch up" with the current email stream release. There will also be a function where the candidate and/or approved users can sign in to the site to write and send emails with approved content.
I would also like to add the ability to list and describe upcoming events which the candidate will participate in. - optional
Volunteer for the campaign - optional
Donate - optional
This project was propelled by the need for new candidates to be able to communicate with interested populations and update them on events and current views of the candidate.

I have been a campaign manager in 2014 for a candidate running for the Kansas State House, although the candidate did not win, I learned a lot and she has decided to run for school board in Kansas and I believe this would be a good functionality for her to "meet" consituents.

My project will be a booking instrument for musician and artists or their manager. To provide a easy way to book venues across the US for musicians wishing to tour. The will be an interactive map to click on the region you wish to book a tour and it will link the artist with smaller venues and the contact information of the venue.
Eventually, I would like the artists to be able to rate each venue for ease of working with and perhaps show quality.
This project is spurred by a friend of mine who recently started a record label and has an artist who will be going out on tour.


### Features
Email signup: visitors to the site will be able to register their email to receive emails.

Email Release schedule: the introduction to the candidate through emails will occur in a prescribed manner.

Share: visitors may share the site with thier friends through email link, twitter or facebook.

User login: Approved Users will be able to log in, either by creating accounts in the system, or by using a third-party authentication provider (e.g. Google Authentication). All access to the site will be restricted to logged-in users.

Volunteer signup: Visitors will be able to add their information to volunteer to the system, and to asign up for volunteering at events.

### Technologies
I will be using Springboot, Thymeleaf, Java, Bootstrap, user authentication, My SQL


### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to authenticate users, perhaps through 3rd party, how to create a framework for getting emails into a DB in SQL and then putting those emails on a "timed" release.
I will have to test this process to make sure it functions as it should.
